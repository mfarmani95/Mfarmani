    <h1 id="introduction">Introduction to Baseflow and Streamflow Prediction</h1>
	  <p>The accuracy of continental-scale hydrological models in predicting streamflow, particularly in dry regions, hinges on their ability to simulate various water balance components, including surface and subsurface runoff, soil moisture retention, as well as groundwater recharge and discharge. Runoff, which includes both surface and subsurface components, plays a critical role in the distribution of water between immediate streamflow and groundwater recharge, impacting baseflow generation. In dry regions, where precipitation is sparse, subsurface runoff becomes especially relevant, as it often contributes to baseflow—a key element in sustaining streamflow during dry periods. Therefore, examining both surface and subsurface runoff provides insight into how different physical process representations in models affect baseflow estimates.</p>
